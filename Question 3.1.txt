::3.1::
::1. Loop Invariants::
1. e = 6
The assignment is executed in every iteration but the value is never modified, nor used until after the loop.

2. j = 12
This is executed in every path in the loop. Result is never modified.

3. l = j + 13
Since j is an invariant this statement will also become an invariant

4. i = 13 + c 
c never changes so i will be a constant too.

5. k = i + j
Since i and j both are invariants, this line will be too.

6. m = c+ i
Since c and i both are invariants, this line will be too.

::3.1::
::2.::
All the invariant instructions can be moved up to the pre-header because doing so will not change the program semantics.
